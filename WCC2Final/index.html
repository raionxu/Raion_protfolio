            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <p>The work is presented in a VR environment, where the scene models are composed using 3D scanning technology to represent the appearance of my "home" from my personal memory.</p>
            Only the area around the hands will be visible in the space, and players will explore objects and space in the darkness through touch-based interactions with their hands.</p> 
            The piece explores the theme of memory while also investigating the relationship between the body and digital space.</p>
