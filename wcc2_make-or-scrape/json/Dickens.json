  "text": "brightness is an attribute of visual perception in which a source appears to be radiating or reflecting light.&#91;1&#93; in other words, brightness is the perception elicited by the luminance of a visual target. the perception is not linear to luminance, and relies on the context of the viewing environment (for example, see white's illusion).brightness is a subjective sensation of an object being observed and one of the color appearance parameters of many color appearance models, typically denoted as q{\\displaystyle q}. brightness refers to how much light appears to shine from something. this is a different perception than lightness, which is how light something appears compared to a similarly lit white object.the adjective  bright derives from an old english beorht with the same meaning via metathesis giving middle english briht. the word is from a common germanic&#42;berhtaz, ultimately from a pie root with a closely related meaning, *bhereg- \"white, bright\".\n\"brightness\" was formerly used as a synonym for the photometric term luminance and (incorrectly) for the radiometric term radiance. as defined by the us federal glossary of telecommunication terms (fs-1037c), \"brightness\" should now be used only for non-quantitative references to physiological sensations and perceptions of light."
