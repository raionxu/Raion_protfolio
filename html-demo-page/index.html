            <h3>Concept</h3>
            <p>This work discuss the relationship between observing and being observed
                Use P5js to create an virtual exhibition hall,</p> where audience will see their 
                own image after entering the interaction area.</p> 
                The art work exists only when it is "observed" by the viewer. </p>
                When the audience looks at the artwork in front of them, they also become 
                part of the artwork.</p>
